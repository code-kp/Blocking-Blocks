# Blocking-Blocks
Built with Python using pygame module, this game looks simple to play but turns out to be a bit difficult. You need to control two blocks without colliding with the other blocks falling on it. What you can do is, toggle the position of the blocks between **right** and **left**.

##Controls
 - **Left Arrow Key** : Toggles position of red block 
 - **Right Arrow Key** : Toggles position of blue block

All you need to do is, save your blocks from getting collided with falling blocks. Simple!
